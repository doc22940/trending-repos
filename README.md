# Trending Repos

Trending Repos is a simple web application that makes use of the GitHub
API to display the most recently created repositories that have the 
highest stars. The application also uses a dynamic loading feature where
more repositories are fetched when scrolling to the bottom of the website.
The user can also visit the repository by clicking on the repository name.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hrishikeshpaul/trending-repos.git
$ cd trending-repos
```
